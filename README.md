# JPMorgan-Chase-Virtual-Internship

Completed **Software Engineering Virtual Experience** offered by **JPMorgan Chase & Co**. I would like to thank **InsideSherpa** for providing a great opportunity. 

The virtual Internship program includes practical task modules in :-

1. Interface with a stock price data feed

   Key learnings: Financial data, Python, Git.

2. Use JPMorgan Chase frameworks and tools

   Key learnings : React, Typescript, Web Applications.

3. Display data visually for traders.

   Key learnings : Technical Communication, Financial Analysis, Web applications.

Through out this virtual internship, I was able to apply Python in a different way to visualize and analyze share price data for potential trading opportunities and gain a greater understanding of data analysis and front end data visualization.
